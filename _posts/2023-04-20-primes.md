The aim of this [project](https://github.com/johnnyoko/parallelized_primes) is to explore the computation of prime numbers, a fundamental topic in mathematics that has been of great interest to mathematicians throughout history. The motivation behind this research is to discover a faster way to find prime numbers computationally, or to uncover new prime numbers. While all numbers under $2^{110000000}-1$ have been checked using Lucas-Lehmer Primality Testing, verifying these numbers manually is not feasible due to their immense size, making the problem computationally expensive. To address this challenge, the study focuses on the use of parallel computing to increase the speed of prime number discovery.

My code implements a benchmark for finding Mersenne primes using the Lucas-Lehmer test. Mersenne primes are prime numbers that are one less than a power of two, i.e., numbers of the form where p is a prime number. The Lucas-Lehmer test is an efficient method for determining whether a given value of p produces a Mersenne prime.

The main body of the code sets up a range of values of max_p from 1 to 2000 (inclusive), and calls the find_mersenne_primes function for each value. It then stores the total time taken for each value of max_p in a list called times. Finally, the code plots a graph of times versus max_p, which shows how the total time taken varies with the number of processors used for the computation. The resulting graph can be used to identify the optimal number of processors to use for this computation.

The graph shows the computation becomes more complex for larger prime exponents. As the maximum prime exponent increases, the total time taken to find Mersenne primes is expected to increase as well. Due to the exponential complexity of the Lucas-Lehmer test optimization is required for finding new primes. For exponential code, the benefits of optimization and parallelization can be particularly significant, as the cost of computation can grow very quickly with the size of the input data. By optimizing and parallelizing the code, it is be possible to reduce the computation time to a level that is practical or even acceptable for the given problem.

The find_mersenne_primes() function uses multiprocessing to distribute the work of finding Mersenne primes across multiple processes. The number of processes to use is specified by the num_processes parameter. The find_mersenne_primes_helper() function is called by find_mersenne_primes() to calculate Mersenne primes in a specific range of prime exponents which allows for distrubuted computing. The lucas_lehmer() function implements the Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne primes. To use find_mersenne_primes() function, it takes two parameters: max_p, which is the maximum prime exponent to test for a Mersenne prime, and num_processes, which is the number of processes to use for parallelization. In the current example, it is finding Mersenne primes up to 2000 using 1, 2, 4, and 8 cores.

Based on the implementation of the Lucas-Lehmer test with parallel processing, we expect that the output of our program will show a significant decrease in the time taken to calculate Mersenne primes as the number of cores used increases. By distributing the computation of Mersenne primes across multiple cores using the multiprocess module, we can take advantage of the parallel computing capabilities of modern CPUs and reduce the overall computation time. The output of my program, which can be found in my GitHub repository, will demonstrate the effectiveness of parallel processing in reducing the time required to calculate Mersenne primes.
